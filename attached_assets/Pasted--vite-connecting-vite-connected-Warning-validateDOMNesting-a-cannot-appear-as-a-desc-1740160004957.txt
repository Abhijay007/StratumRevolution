One giant leap
for bitcoin mining
Stratum V2 is the next generation protocol for pooled mining.
It increases security, makes data transfers more efficient, and reduces mining infrastructure requirements.

Mining Power Distribution
Currently, just 5 mining pools control over 83% of Bitcoin's total hashrate

Why This Matters
This high concentration of mining power in a few pools creates significant risks:
•
Pools can potentially censor transactions by choosing which ones to include in blocks
•
A small group of entities could collude to enforce transaction filtering
•
This undermines Bitcoin's fundamental promise of censorship resistance
Control Your Revenue
Take charge of your mining operation. Don't let pools decide which transactions make it into blocks or trust them to share all fee revenue.
Current Reality
Pools control transaction selection, potentially hiding high-fee transactions and making out-of-band deals
